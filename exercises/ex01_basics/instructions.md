# Exercise 01 - Git Basics

## Introduction

Welcome to the first (and main) exercise of this Git workshop! This exercise will guide you through all the essential Git commands and workflows you need to know as a developer.

You'll learn by doing - each step builds on the previous one, and by the end, you'll have a solid understanding of Git fundamentals.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Configure Git with your identity
- Create and manage files with Git
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Push changes to GitHub
- Review your commit history

---

## Step 1: Repository Setup & Configuration

### 1.1 Fork and Clone the Repository

First, fork this repository to your own GitHub account, then clone it:

```bash
# Clone your forked repository (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/workshop-git-github.git

# Navigate into the repository
cd workshop-git-github
```

### 1.2 Check Your Git Configuration

Git needs to know who you are to attribute commits correctly:

```bash
# Check your current configuration
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

### 1.3 Configure Git (if needed)

If the commands above don't show your name and email, configure them now:

```bash
# Set your name
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Set your email (use the same email as your GitHub account)
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Tip:** The `--global` flag means this configuration applies to all your Git repositories.

### 1.4 Verify Everything is Working

```bash
# Check the repository status
git status
```

You should see a message like "nothing to commit, working tree clean" (or similar depending on current state).

---

## Step 2: Your First Commit

Now let's create your first file and make your first commit!

### 2.1 Create Your Profile

```bash
# Copy the template file to create your profile
cp assets/modele_profile.md profile.md
```

### 2.2 Personalize Your Profile

Open `profile.md` in your code editor and:
- Replace `XXXX` with your **first name**
- Replace `YYYY` with your **last name**

Save the file when you're done.

### 2.3 Check What Changed

```bash
# See what Git has detected
git status
```

You should see `profile.md` listed as an "untracked file" - this means Git sees it but isn't tracking it yet.

### 2.4 Stage Your Changes

```bash
# Add the file to the staging area
git add profile.md
```

**What does staging mean?** It's like putting items in a shopping cart before checkout. You're preparing what will be included in your next commit.

### 2.5 Check Status Again

```bash
git status
```

Now `profile.md` should appear as "Changes to be committed" - it's staged and ready!

### 2.6 Create Your First Commit

```bash
# Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "feat: add personal profile"
```

**Note the commit type:** We use `feat:` because we're adding a new feature (your profile).

### 2.7 Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push your changes to GitHub
git push
```

**Congratulations!** You just made your first proper commit and pushed it to GitHub. Go check your repository on GitHub - you should see your new file!

---

## Step 3: Making Corrections

Mistakes happen! Let's practice fixing them.

### 3.1 Fix the Typo

Open your `profile.md` file again. You'll notice there's an intentional typo in the template: "I am intrested in programming" should be "I am **interested** in programming".

Fix this typo and save the file.

### 3.2 Check What Changed

```bash
# See the file is modified
git status

# Optional: see the exact changes
git diff
```

**What is `git diff`?** It shows you exactly what changed in your files (additions in green, deletions in red).

### 3.3 Stage and Commit the Fix

```bash
# Stage the correction
git add profile.md

# Commit with a fix message
git commit -m "fix: correct typo in profile description"
```

**Note the commit type:** We use `fix:` because we're correcting an error.

### 3.4 Push Your Correction

```bash
git push
```

---

## Step 4: Adding Documentation

Good developers document their learning. Let's create a notes file.

### 4.1 Create Your Notes File

```bash
# Create a new file (you can also create it with your editor)
touch notes.md
```

### 4.2 Add Content to Your Notes

Open `notes.md` in your editor and add your learnings. For example:

```markdown
# My Git Learning Notes

## Commands I've Learned

- `git status` - Shows the current state of my repository
- `git add <file>` - Stages a file for commit
- `git commit -m "message"` - Creates a commit with a message
- `git push` - Sends my commits to GitHub
- `git diff` - Shows what changed in my files

## Key Concepts

- **Staging area**: Where I prepare files before committing
- **Commit**: A snapshot of my work at a specific point in time
- **Commit conventions**: Using prefixes like feat:, fix:, docs: to categorize changes
```

Feel free to add your own observations and learnings!

### 4.3 Commit Your Documentation

```bash
# Stage the new file
git add notes.md

# Commit with a docs type
git commit -m "docs: add personal learning notes"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

**Note the commit type:** We use `docs:` because we're adding documentation.

---

## Step 5: Cleaning Up

Projects accumulate files. Let's practice removing unnecessary files.

### 5.1 Create a Test File

```bash
# Create a temporary test file
touch test.txt
```

### 5.2 Stage and Commit It (we'll remove it in the next step)

```bash
git add test.txt
git commit -m "chore: add test file"
git push
```

### 5.3 Remove the Test File

```bash
# Remove the file using Git
git rm test.txt

# Check status
git status
```

**Why use `git rm` instead of just deleting the file?** `git rm` deletes the file AND stages the deletion in one command.

### 5.4 Commit the Removal

```bash
git commit -m "chore: remove test file"
git push
```

**Note the commit type:** We use `chore:` for maintenance tasks like cleanup.

---

## Step 6: Review Your Work

Let's look at everything you've accomplished!

### 6.1 View Your Commit History

```bash
# See a compact log of all commits
git log --oneline
```

You should see all your commits listed with their messages. This is a great way to review what you've done.

### 6.2 View Detailed History

```bash
# See more detailed information
git log
```

This shows:
- Commit hash (unique identifier)
- Author (that's you!)
- Date and time
- Commit message

### 6.3 View a Pretty Graph (optional but cool!)

```bash
# See a visual representation
git log --oneline --graph --decorate
```

---

## Step 7: Final Documentation

Let's wrap up with one final commit documenting what you've learned.

### 7.1 Update Your Notes

Open `notes.md` again and add a section at the end:

```markdown

## What I Accomplished in This Workshop

- Configured Git with my identity
- Created my first commit
- Fixed mistakes using proper commit messages
- Added documentation
- Learned to clean up files properly
- Reviewed my commit history

## Next Steps

- Practice Git daily in my projects
- Explore branching and merging
- Learn about pull requests
- Contribute to open source projects
```

### 7.2 Final Commit

```bash
# Stage your updated notes
git add notes.md

# Commit your final documentation
git commit -m "docs: document workshop accomplishments"

# Push everything to GitHub
git push
```

### 7.3 Admire Your Work!

Go to your GitHub repository and:
- Check the commit history
- View your `profile.md`
- Read your `notes.md`
- Notice how clean and professional your commit messages are!
