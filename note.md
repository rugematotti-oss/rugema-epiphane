# My Git Learning Notes

## Commands I've Learned

- `git status` - Shows the current state of my repository
- `git add <file>` - Stages a file for commit
- `git commit -m "message"` - Creates a commit with a message
- `git push` - Sends my commits to GitHub
- `git diff` - Shows what changed in my files

## Key Concepts

- **Staging area**: Where I prepare files before committing
- **Commit**: A snapshot of my work at a specific point in time
- **Commit conventions**: Using prefixes like feat:, fix:, docs: to categorize changes
